Vehicles

The following project contains two subtasks:

Subtask 1: You are given the classes Vehicle, Car, and F1. Complete the driver code of each of these classes.
Subtask 2: You are given the interface WaterVehicle. Construct a new class Boat
(with exactly the same and member variables as given below).

The details of the classes that constitute the project are:

Vehicle: name, currentSpeed, currentDirection

constructor: given the name of the vehicle, initialize speed and direction as 0.
move(speed, direction): set the current speed and direction
steer(direction): Add direction to the currentDirection
stop(): Stop the car by setting current speed to 0
Car: extends Vehicle

constructor: initialize the variables using parameters and set currentGear as 1.
changeGear(newGear): set the current gear to newGear parameter.
changeSpeed(newSpeed, newDirection): set the speed and direction using move().
F1: extends Car

accelerate(rate): add rate to the current speed and change the gear accordingly
Boat: implements WaterVehicle interface

Has following member variables: a. name : of String type b. capacity : of int type
Return name and capacity in getVehicleName and getVehicleCapacity respectively.
Note:

Make sure that the class names are exactly the same.
